# go_api's

This project is a collection of api types, using different packages and different ways, that I've been using and experimenting to understand more about the GoLang.

`Note`
```
The examples 1 and 2 do not advise looking, as they are more beginners and messier. I left them more as history.

## [Exemple 3](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/example3)
This project was developed together with the Udemy course [Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/aprenda-golang-do-zero-desenvolva-uma-aplicacao-completa/).

The project is not exactly a thing, as it has some modifications of mine, due to my knowledge in a finished subject being greater than the presented one.

It's an api of a mini social network, with user registrations and publications.


## [Auth](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/go_auth)
This project aims to understand the GoLang JWT package only.


## [External Request](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/go_external_request)
Most api need information outside their scope, and to get this information it makes external requests to other APIs. And this project aims to show how an external request is made for other applications.
