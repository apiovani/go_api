# go_api's

This project is a collection of api types, using different packages and different ways, that I've been using and experimenting to understand more about the GoLang.

`Note`
```
The examples 1 and 2 do not advise looking, as they are more beginners and messier. I left them more as history.

## [Exemple 3](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/example3)
This project was developed together with the Udemy course [Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/aprenda-golang-do-zero-desenvolva-uma-aplicacao-completa/).

The project is not exactly a thing, as it has some modifications of mine, due to my knowledge in a finished subject being greater than the presented one.

It's an api of a mini social network, with user registrations and publications.
